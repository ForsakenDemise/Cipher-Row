CASE I. DOCUMENTATION 

The program we created allows the user to determine:
1. Calculate the distance between two cities,
2. Locate the shortest path between two cities, 
and lastly 3. Calculate the lowest cost trips.

The programming approaches is as followed:
it prompts the user to select one of the three options above.
Once an option is chosen, the user is again prompted to choose the two cities.
The program then starts the function based on the user's input. 
Once the program has finished its executions, it returns back to the menu selection.
Once it returns back to the menu selection, it allows the user to make another selection if needed.

If selection 1 is chosen it uses the adjacency matrix to determine the distance between the two cities the user chooses.
If selection 2 is chosen it uses the breadth first search to locate the shortest path between the two cities chosen.
