# Cipher-Row
CASE III. DOCUMENTATION
 
Using C++, we created a program that encrypts and decrypts messages using the Vigenere Cipher. The programming approaches allows the user to choose their string text. Once it is chosen, the program then encrypts and decrypts the string text. The algorithm is integrated in the program by using a form of polyalphabetic cipher, which is just a form of substitution. It uses multiple substitution alphabets. 

The application of course concepts include the encryption and decryption of the string text chosen by the user. Vigenere Cipher’s concept is to take a string text and use the Vigenere’s square with the keyword. With the help of the comments on the program, it was made to be understood for any user accessing the program. The concept itself is not something a beginner can take from this program, it is more for an intermediate user. Although a beginner might not understand the concept, with the aid of the comments they can indeed walk away with an encrypted and decrypted string text.
